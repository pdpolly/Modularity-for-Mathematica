# Modularity-for-Mathematica
The basic component of studying modularity and integration is identifying packages of intercorrelated traits that behave independently of other such packages, whether through ontogeny, across individuals within a population, or during the course of evolution.  This package performs a simple analysis of modularity on geometric morphometric landmark data.  This package accompanies the review by Goswami and Polly (2010).  Users are referred to that paper for a discussion of the methods embedded in this package, including their strengths and weaknesses, and for elaboration of other methods that address broader problems.
