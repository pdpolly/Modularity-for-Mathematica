# Modularity-for-Mathematica
The basic component of studying modularity and integration is identifying packages of intercorrelated traits that behave independently of other such packages, whether through ontogeny, across individuals within a population, or during the course of evolution.  This package performs a simple analysis of modularity on geometric morphometric landmark data.  This package accompanies the review by Goswami and Polly (2010).  Users are referred to that paper for a discussion of the methods embedded in this package, including their strengths and weaknesses, and for elaboration of other methods that address broader problems.  

<b>Installing the Modularity for Mathematica package</b>
<ol>
<li>Download the latest version of the package at https://github.com/pdpolly/Modularity-for-Mathematica/ (right click on link to save as file)</li>
<li>Open the file in Mathematica</li>
<li>Under the File menu, choose “Install”</li>
<li>Under Type of Item choose “Package”, under source choose the file you just saved, under Install Name enter “Modularity”.</li>
<li>Once installed, enter the command “<<Modularity`” to use the functions.</li>
</ol>

<b>Updates in 2.0</b> This package was updated 7 April 2018 to fix inconsistencies with the latest versions of Mathematica.  No substantial changes were made to functions.  Updates include changing Agglomerate[] to DirectAgglomerate[] for functions that calculate dendrograms from correlation matrices and no longer loading the Multivariate Statistics package to use the PrincipalComponents[] function.
